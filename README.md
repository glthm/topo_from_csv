# Topo_from_csv

## Rationale
For the climbing gym I volunteer at ([4+](http://quatreplus.org)), we have the list of all routes on [Oblyk](https://oblyk.org) that we can export as a CSV (technically a TSV), but that we would like to format as we want. We open the CSV as an XLS, format it, and remove unwanted columns.

## Input
The input file is a TSV export of the routes of your climbing gym, generated by [Oblyk](https://oblyk.org).

## Output
Generates a formatted XLS file containing the routes of the climbing gym.
